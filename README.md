# weather-app

This code creates a basic weather app webpage. It allows users to enter a city name, and when they click the search button, it fetches weather information using the OpenWeatherMap API. The weather details, such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed, are displayed along with an icon representing the current weather conditions. If the entered city is invalid, an error message is shown. The code uses HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript to handle user input and API requests.
